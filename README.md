## Key Features Explained

### AEMO Spike Detection (Tesla only)

This option is primarily intended for Tesla Powerwall users with VPPs that offer AEMO Spike exports (Globird, AGL, Engie) but don't natively support Tesla batteries. Sigenergy users on Globird don't need this feature as Globird natively supports Sigenergy for spike exports.

When prices exceed your configured threshold (e.g., $300/MWh), the system:
- Saves your current tariff configuration
- Saves your current Powerwall operation mode
- Switches to autonomous (TOU) mode
- Uploads a spike tariff with very high sell rates to encourage battery export
- Restores your original operation mode when spike ends
- Restores your normal tariff when prices return to normal

**Monitoring Frequency:** Checks AEMO prices every 1 minute.

### Solar Curtailment

Prevents paying to export solar during negative pricing periods (≤0c/kWh).

| Battery System | Method | Behavior |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| **Tesla** | Export rules API | Sets export to "never", restores to "battery_ok" when positive |
| **Sigenergy** | Modbus TCP | Sets export limit to 0kW (load-following mode) |

**Sigenergy Load-Following Mode:**
- ✅ Solar continues powering the house
- ✅ Battery still charges from solar
- ✅ Only grid export is blocked during negative prices

### Spike Protection (Amber Only)

Prevents your battery from charging from the grid during Amber price spikes. When wholesale prices spike, your battery may see an arbitrage opportunity and charge from grid - this feature stops that behavior.

**How It Works:**
When Amber reports `spikeStatus: 'potential'` or `'spike'` for a period, buy prices are overridden to ensure charging from grid is always unprofitable during spikes.

### Export Price Boost

Artificially increases export prices sent to your battery system to trigger exports at lower price points. Useful when Amber export prices are in the 20-25c range where the battery's algorithm may not trigger exports.

**Configuration Options:**
| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Enable Export Price Boost | Toggle the feature on/off | Off |
| Price Offset (c/kWh) | Fixed amount added to all export prices | 0 |
| Minimum Price (c/kWh) | Floor for export prices | 0 |
| Activation Threshold (c/kWh) | Boost only applies if actual price is at or above this value | 0 |
| Boost Start Time | When to start applying boost | 17:00 |
| Boost End Time | When to stop applying boost | 21:00 |

### Chip Mode

Suppress battery exports during configured hours (typically overnight) unless the price exceeds a threshold.

**Configuration Options:**
| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Enable Chip Mode | Toggle the feature on/off | Off |
| Start Time | When to start suppressing exports | 22:00 |
| End Time | When to stop suppressing exports | 06:00 |
| Price Threshold (c/kWh) | Allow exports only above this price | 30 |

## Sigenergy Battery System Support

Full support for Sigenergy DC-coupled battery systems as an alternative to Tesla Powerwall.

**Features:**
- **Tariff Sync via Cloud API** - Uploads Amber pricing to Sigenergy Cloud using the same 30-minute TOU format
- **Real-Time Energy Data via Modbus** - Reads solar, battery, grid power and SOC from your inverter
- **DC Solar Curtailment** - Controls DC solar via Modbus TCP during negative prices (load-following mode)

**Connection Requirements:**
| Connection | Purpose | Required |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Cloud API** | Tariff sync to Sigenergy | ✅ Yes |
| **Modbus TCP** | Real-time energy data + DC curtailment | ✅ Yes |

> ⚠️ **Important:** Modbus TCP Server must be enabled on your Sigenergy inverter before PowerSync can connect. This setting is typically configured by your installer via the SigenStor app or installer portal. If you're getting "Connection refused" errors, contact your installer to enable "Modbus TCP Server" on the inverter.
>
> **Device ID Note:** If you have an AC Charger installed, it uses Device ID 1 by default. The inverter must be set to a higher ID (e.g., 2). Confirm your Device ID configuration with your installer.
