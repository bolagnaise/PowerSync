# App Store Review Response - PowerSync

## Response to Guideline 5.2.1 - Intellectual Property

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your detailed feedback. I am providing the following clarification regarding the intellectual property concerns.

### PowerSync's Relationship with Third-Party Hardware

PowerSync is an **independent third-party application** that I have developed. It is:
- NOT affiliated with Tesla, Inc.
- NOT endorsed by Tesla, Inc.
- NOT using any proprietary Tesla cloud APIs or services

### How PowerSync Works

PowerSync connects to home energy hardware (such as Tesla Powerwall) using **local network APIs only**:

1. **Local Network Communication:** The app communicates directly with hardware on the user's home WiFi network, similar to how other smart home apps control local devices.

2. **No Cloud Dependencies:** The app does not access Tesla's cloud services, Tesla accounts, or any Tesla authentication systems.

3. **User-Owned Hardware:** Users connect to hardware they own and have physical access to, on their own local network.

4. **Documented Local Interfaces:** Tesla Powerwall provides a local web interface (accessible at the Gateway's IP address) that the app uses. This is the same interface accessible via any web browser on the local network.

### Precedent: Similar Approved Apps

Several similar apps are available on the App Store that also interface with Tesla hardware:

| App | App Store ID | Description |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| Netzero for Powerwall | 6453293821 | Powerwall automation and monitoring |
| Stats for Tesla | 1191100729 | Tesla vehicle statistics (includes disclaimer) |
| Tessie | Available on App Store | Tesla vehicle management |

### Updates Made

I have updated the app to include clear disclaimers:

**App Store Description (added):**
> "Disclaimer: PowerSync is an independent third-party application developed by Ben Boller. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or connected to Tesla, Inc., Amber Electric, or any hardware manufacturer listed above. Tesla, Powerwall, and other product names are trademarks of their respective owners and are used solely for identification purposes."

**Terms of Service (Section 2.1):**
> "PowerSync is an independent third-party application. The App is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or connected to Tesla, Inc., Amber Electric Pty Ltd, or any hardware manufacturer whose products are compatible with the App."

### Summary

PowerSync provides value to users by:
- Automating their home battery based on real-time electricity prices
- Working entirely on the local network without cloud dependencies
- Supporting multiple brands of energy hardware

The app uses third-party trademarks (Tesla, Powerwall) solely for identification purposes to describe hardware compatibility, which is nominative fair use.

I have added clear disclaimers to prevent any confusion about affiliation.

## Response to Guideline 2.1 - Demo Video

I will provide a demo video showing:
1. A physical iPhone running the PowerSync app
2. My physical Tesla Powerwall 3 installation
3. The initial connection/setup process via local network
4. The app controlling the Powerwall (changing modes, viewing status)

The video will be filmed with an external camera showing both the phone and the Powerwall hardware.

**Demo Video Link:** [To be added after filming]

## Response to Guideline 2.3.3 - iPad Screenshots

I will upload new iPad screenshots taken directly on iPad hardware (or iPad Simulator at correct resolution) that accurately reflect the app's iPad interface.
