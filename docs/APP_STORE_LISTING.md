**Notes for Reviewer:**
This app connects to home energy hardware (battery systems and inverters) via local network APIs. The user must own the hardware and have it installed on their home network. The app does not use any proprietary Tesla cloud APIs - it communicates directly with the hardware over the user's local network using documented local interfaces.
